# DataGenerator
This is a very convenient debugging tool that allows you to generate different types of serialized Inferris data that you can plug into the Redis client terminal to hash set key fields.

## Data generation types
### PlayerData account generation
This allows you to generate serialized dummy PlayerData objects. You are able to set registry information, rank information, and profile information.

### Friends list generation
You can generate a serialized friends list with as many UUIDs as you prefer.

### Username and UUID generation
This randomly generates both a username and a UUID that you can use for PlayerData/friends list generations.
